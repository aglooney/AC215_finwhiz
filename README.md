# FinWhiz

**FinWhiz** is an AI-powered financial education app designed to make finance accessible and personalized.  
It leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to provide two complementary experiences:

1. **Financial Education Chatbot**  
   - Ask general finance-related questions (e.g., "What’s the difference between a Roth IRA and a traditional IRA?").  
   - The chatbot retrieves information from curated financial education resources and explains concepts in clear, simple language.
<!-- 
2. **Personal Finance Assistant**  
   - Securely input your own financial information (e.g., income, expenses, savings goals).  
   - The chatbot uses a dedicated RAG pipeline over your personal data to answer tailored questions like:  
     > "Based on my current spending, how much can I safely put into retirement savings each month?" -->

## Features

- **RAG-powered chatbot** for accurate, context-aware responses.  
- **Two data layers**:
  - **General knowledge base** of financial concepts.  
  - **User-specific knowledge base** for personalized advice.  
<!-- - **Privacy-first design** — personal data stays separate from the general model context.  
- **Interactive UI** for chatting, data entry, and visualizing insights.   -->
