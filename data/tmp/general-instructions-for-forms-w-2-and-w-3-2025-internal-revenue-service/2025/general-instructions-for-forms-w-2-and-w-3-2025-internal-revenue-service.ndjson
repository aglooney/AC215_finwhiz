Instead, report on Form SSA-131 the total amount the employee earned during the year. Generally, the amount earned by the employee during the tax year for purposes of item 6 of Form SSA-131 is the amount reported in box 1 of Form W-2 plus current-year deferrals that are vested (employee and employer portions) less distributions. Do not consider prior-year deferrals that are vesting in the current year. If there was a plan failure, the box 1 amount in this calculation should be as if there were no plan failure. Submit the Form SSA-131 to the nearest SSA office or give it to the employee. Example 5—Deferral, immediately vested, and distributions. No vesting of prior-year deferrals.

For example, immediately vested employer contributions to NQDC made late in the year would have no effect on Form W-2, box 1, but they would affect FICA and FUTA taxes. Estimated Method Under the estimated method, an employer may treat a reasonably estimated amount as wages paid on the last day of the calendar year (the “first year”). If the employer underestimates the amount deferred and, thereby, underdeposits social security, Medicare, or FUTA taxes, it can choose to treat the shortfall as wages either in the first year or the first quarter of the next year. The shortfall does not include income credited to the amount deferred after the first year. Conversely, if the amount deferred is overestimated, the employer can claim a refund or credit. If the employer chooses to treat the shortfall as wages in the first year, the employer must issue a Form W-2c. Also, the employer must correct the information on the Form 941 for the last quarter of the first year. In such a case, the shortfall will not be treated as a late deposit subject to penalty if it is deposited by the employer's first regular deposit date following the first quarter of the next year. Lag Method Under the lag method, an employer may calculate the end-of-the-year amount on any date in the first quarter of the next calendar year. The amount deferred will be treated as wages on that date, and the amount deferred that would otherwise have been taken into account on the last day of the first year must be increased by income earned on that amount through the date on which the amount is taken into account.
