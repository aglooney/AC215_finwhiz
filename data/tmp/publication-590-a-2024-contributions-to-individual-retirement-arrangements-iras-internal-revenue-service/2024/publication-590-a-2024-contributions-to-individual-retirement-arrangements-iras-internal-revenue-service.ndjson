Under the terms of the plan, employer contributions don’t have to be made, but if they are made, they are contributed to the plan before the due date for filing the company's tax return. Such contributions are allocated as of the last day of the plan year, and allocations are made to the accounts of individuals who have any service during the plan year. As of June 30, 2024, no contributions were made that were allocated to the June 30, 2024, plan year, and no forfeitures had been allocated within the plan year. In addition, as of that date, the company wasn’t obligated to make a contribution for such plan year, and it was impossible to determine whether or not a contribution would be made for the plan year. On December 31, 2024, the company decided to contribute to the plan for the plan year ending June 30, 2024. That contribution was made on February 15, 2025.
